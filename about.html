                    entail. Sports are part of every culture past and present, but each culture has its own definition
                    of sports. The most useful definitions are those that clarify the relationship of sports to play,
                    games, and contests. “Play,” wrote the German theorist Carl Diem, “is purposeless activity, for its
                    own sake, the opposite of work.” Humans work because they have to; they play because they want to.
                    Play is autotelic—that is, it has its own goals. It is voluntary and uncoerced.

                <h1>Game of India</h1>
                <p>India is home to diverse population playing different games. India has won many Olympic medals in
                    sports. It is the origin of games like Hockey, Chess, Gilli Danda. </p>
                <h3>Chess</h3>
                <p>Chess is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess
                    pieces, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king. It is sometimes called international
                    chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and
                    shogi (Japanese chess). The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a
                    similar game, chaturanga, in seventh century India. The rules of chess as they are known today
                    emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by
                    the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, and is played by
                    millions of people worldwide.Shatranj or chaturanga are the ancient names for Chess. Archaeologist
                    found the remains of this game roughly, 1,500 years ago. It is a board game which requires minimum
                    two players. the board is 8 x 8. Each player in the game has 6 set of pieces namely 1 King, 1 Queen,
                    2 Rook, 2 Knights, 2 Bishops and 8 pawns. Checkmate or also known as shat-Mat is referred as the
                    defeat of King.
                </p>
                <h3>Kho-Kho</h3>
                <p>Kho kho is a traditional Indian sport that dates back to ancient India.[1][2] It is the second-most
                    popular traditional tag game in the Indian subcontinent after kabaddi.[3] Kho kho is played on a
                    rectangular court with a central lane connecting two poles which are at either end of the court.
                    During the game, nine players from the chasing team (attacking team) are on the field, with eight of
                    them sitting (crouched) in the central lane, while three runners from the defending team run around
                    the court and try to avoid being touched.[2] Each sitting player on the chasing team faces the
                    opposite half of the field that their adjacent teammates are facing.

                    Kho Kho was originated in India in the 3rd century. Therefore, kho kho is one of the oldest tag
                    games in India besides kabaddi. There are 12 players in a team and out of which 9 enter the field
                    and others run along the field. Players face the opposite directions in a single line.
                </p>
                <h3>Polo</h3>
                <p>Polo is a ball game that is played on horseback, a traditional field sport and one of the world's
                    oldest known team sports.[9] The game is played by two opposing teams with the objective of scoring
                    using a long-handled wooden mallet to hit a small hard ball through the opposing team's goal. Each
                    team has four mounted riders, and the game usually lasts one to two hours, divided into periods
                    called chukkas or chukkers. Polo is played riding on horses back. It lasted from the 6th century BC
                    to 1st century AD. India has set the modern polo in 115th century AD by Mughal emperor. Therefore, ”
                    Sport of Kings” is the other name of this game. In some places, polo was played by riding on
                    elephants back and hence it was called “Elephant Polo”.

                <h1>Volleyball</h1>
                <p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players arecausing the ball to touch the ground
                    or floor outside the opponents' court or without first passing over the net;
                    catching and throwing the ball;
                    double hit: two consecutive contacts with the ball made by the same player; separated by a net. Each
                    team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1]
                    It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach
                    volleyball was introduced to the programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version
                    of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic Games is sitting volleyball.
                    Typically, the first two touches are used to set up for an attack. An attack is an attempt to direct
                    the ball back over the net in such a way that the team receiving the ball is unable to pass the ball
                    and continue the rally, thus, losing the point. The team that wins the rally is awarded a point and
                    serves the ball to start the next rally. A few of the most common faults include:

                <h1>Fitness</h1>
                <p>Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy.[5] Around 1950, perhaps
                    consistent with the Industrial Revolution and the treatise of World War II, the term "fitness"
                    increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten.[6] The modern definition of fitness describes
                    either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of
                    human adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human
                    fitness and physical attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment
                    industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant
                    aerobic or anaerobic ability (i.e., endurance or strength). A well-rounded fitness program improves
                    a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only cardio/respiratory
                    or only weight training.

                <h1>Handball</h1>
                <p>Handball (also known as team handball, European handball or Olympic handball)[3] is a team sport in
                    which two teams of seven players each (six outcourt players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using
                    their hands with the aim of throwing it into the goal of the opposing team. A standard match
                    consists of two periods of 30 minutes, and the team that scores more goals wins.

                    The modern set of rules was published in 1917 by Karl Schelenz, Max Heiser, and Erich Konigh,[5] on
                    29 October in Berlin, which day is seen as the date of birth of the sport.[1][6] The rules have had
                    several revisions since. The first official handball match was played in 1917 in Germany.[1] Karl
                    Schelenz modified the rules in 1919.[5] The first international games were played (under these
                    rules) with men in 1925 (between Germany and Belgium) and with women in 1930 (between Germany and
                    Austria).[7]
